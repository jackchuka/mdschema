# Insufficient Go Examples

This document has only one Go code block in Usage section (requires 2).

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
go install github.com/example/insufficient
```

## Usage

Here's the only Go example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("This is the only Go example")
}
```

But here's a Python example that doesn't count:

```python
print("This is Python, not Go")
```
