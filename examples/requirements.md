# E-Commerce Platform Requirements

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a new e-commerce platform that will serve small to medium-sized businesses. The scope includes user management, product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and order management functionality.

## Functional Requirements

### FR001: User Registration

The system shall allow new users to create accounts with email and password. Users must provide valid email addresses and passwords meeting security criteria.

### FR002: User Authentication

The system shall authenticate users using email and password credentials. The system must support secure login sessions and password reset functionality.

### FR003: Product Catalog Management

The system shall allow administrators to add, edit, and remove products from the catalog. Products must include name, description, price, and inventory quantity.

### FR004: Shopping Cart

The system shall allow users to add products to a shopping cart. Users must be able to modify quantities and remove items from their cart.

### FR005: Order Processing

The system shall process customer orders and generate order confirmations. The system must update inventory levels when orders are placed.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

The system shall have a response time of less than 2 seconds for all user interactions. The system must support a throughput of at least 1000 concurrent users.

### Security

The system shall implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. All sensitive data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

### Scalability

The system shall be designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load.

### Reliability

The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours.

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

The system will use a microservices architecture with separate services for user management, product catalog, and order processing.

### Technology Stack

```
Backend: Node.js with Express framework
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
Frontend: React with TypeScript
Payment: Stripe API integration
```

### Infrastructure

The system will be deployed on AWS using containerized services with Docker and Kubernetes.

## User Stories

As a customer, I want to browse products by category So that I can easily find items I'm interested in purchasing.

As a customer, I want to add items to my shopping cart So that I can purchase multiple items at once.

As an administrator, I want to manage product inventory So that customers see accurate stock levels.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a user is on the product page, When they click "Add to Cart", Then the item shall be added to their shopping cart and the cart counter must update.

Given a customer has items in their cart, When they proceed to checkout, Then they shall be prompted to enter payment information.

Given an administrator updates product inventory, When customers view the product, Then they must see the updated stock quantity.

## Constraints

### Business Constraints

The platform must comply with PCI DSS requirements for payment processing.

### Technical Constraints

The system must integrate with existing accounting software via REST APIs.

### Time Constraints

The initial version must be delivered within 6 months of project start.

## Dependencies

The payment processing functionality depends on Stripe API availability and integration.

The inventory management depends on integration with the existing warehouse management system.

## Assumptions

We assume that users will have modern web browsers with JavaScript enabled.

We assume that the existing warehouse system provides real-time inventory data via API.

## Risks

### Technical Risks

Integration with legacy warehouse systems may present compatibility challenges.

### Business Risks

Changes in payment processing regulations could impact implementation timeline.

### Mitigation Strategies

Conduct early integration testing with warehouse systems to identify compatibility issues.

Monitor regulatory changes and maintain flexible payment processing architecture.

## Success Metrics

The primary success metric will be order completion rate exceeding 85%.

Customer satisfaction scores must measure above 4.0 out of 5.0.

System uptime metric shall exceed 99.5% monthly average.

## Glossary

**SKU**: Stock Keeping Unit - unique identifier for each product variant
**PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
**API**: Application Programming Interface
